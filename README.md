# Arabic-Hate-Speech-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to build a deep learning model for detecting hate speech in Arabic texts. The model is trained on labeled Arabic datasets and is capable of distinguishing between hateful and non-hateful content.

Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Used a labeled Arabic dataset for hate speech detection.


Model Architecture:

Leveraged transformer models from Hugging Face, primarily AraBERT, for text classification.

Fine-tuned the model using Trainer from the transformers library.

Custom evaluation metrics were used (F1-score, accuracy).
